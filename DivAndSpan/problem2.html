    <h2>Problem : The Div element</h2>

        <span class="mySpan1">The Rise of AI:</span> In the not-so-distant
        future, AI had become an integral part of everyday life. From
        <span class="mySpan1">self-driving cars</span> to personalized<span
          class="mySpan1"
          >virtual assistants</span
        >, it was hard to imagine a world without these intelligent machines.
        People marveled at the progressâ€”how algorithms learned from data,
        adapted, and made decisions. But with great power came great
        responsibility. As AI systems grew more complex, questions arose:
        <span class="mySpan2">Could they truly understand human emotions?</span>
        <span class="mySpan2"> Could they ever experience consciousness?</span>
        The answers remained elusive, hidden within the intricate neural
        networks that powered them.
